#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Human-in-the-loop reproduction loop.
# Adapted from mattpocock/skills (MIT).
# Copy this file, edit the steps below, and run it.
# The agent runs the script; the user follows prompts in their terminal.
#
# Usage:
#   bash hitl-loop.template.sh
#
# Two helpers:
#   step "<instruction>"          → show instruction, wait for Enter
#   capture VAR "<question>"      → show question, read response into VAR
#
# At the end, captured values are printed as KEY=VALUE for the agent to parse.
#
# `capture` prints its value back to the terminal, where the agent reads it,
# so capture observations, and leave signing in to the user as a `step`.
